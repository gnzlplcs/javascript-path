# JavaScript Path

Another attempt to keep in my mind JavaScript and related content concepts.

These annotations and code were taken from the Sitepoint's path [Full Stack JavaScript Developer](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/paths/full-stack-javascript-developer/). Indeed, there are so many sources and platforms online to learn JavaScript, like Scrimba (one of my favorites), Platzi, Codecademy, etc. However, this time I chose Sitepoint because I like so much to read, and I fell I can learn deepen when I read and take notes.

ðŸŽ‰ So let's go.
